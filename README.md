# Guessing Game starter

## Get setup
Clone this file into your local computer by either 
clicking the button or run a command like
`git clone https://github.com/ThomasLiARDJAVA/Guessing-Game-Starter.git`
in your terminal. 

You are provided with starter code, try to read and
understand the starter code. I have commented the
meaning and use of the varaibles, so it shouldn't be too
hard to understand

In this assignment, you are ask to complete
a guessing game program that allows users to
enter guesses from 1 - 100, and the answer is auto
generated(this part is done for you)

## Get started
### 1. figure out the condition
figure out the condition for the while statement
it should terminate when user enter the correct answer

### 2. figure out what to put in the loop
after you figure out the condition, you should see
what I have put for you as instructions before the for
loop.

```
/* TODO:
            Please go ahead and fill in the condition of the while
            it definitely is not true, fill in the code so that it does
            the following things:
            1. tells user if his/her guess is wrong
            2. tell user if his/her guess is too big/small
            3. tell user to enter his/her guess in new range
            eg: answer -> 30 user enters -> 23
            you should print:
                "You got the wrong answer"
                "Your answer is too small"
                "Please enter you guess in the range from 24-100"
                "This is your 1 try"
                answer -> 30 user enters -> 40
             you should print:
                "You got the wrong answer"
                "Your answer is too big"
                "Please enter you guess in the range from 24-39"
                "This is your 2 try"
                answer -> 30 user enters -> 30
             you should print:
                "Congrats, you got the answer with 3 attempt"
         */
```
You may use if statements, and System.out.println statements to complete
this assignment. Have fun coding
